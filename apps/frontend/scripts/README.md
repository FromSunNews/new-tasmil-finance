# Frontend Scripts

This directory contains utility scripts for the frontend application.

## Scripts

### `fix-path-params.js`
Fixes empty PathParams interfaces generated by Kubb. This is a workaround for Kubb not properly parsing path parameters from OpenAPI spec.

**Usage:**
```bash
node scripts/fix-path-params.js
```

### `post-generate.js`
Comprehensive post-generation script that fixes multiple issues with Kubb generated code:
- Empty PathParams interfaces
- Duplicate enum exports
- Export type issues

**Usage:**
```bash
node scripts/post-generate.js
```

This script is automatically run after `pnpm generate:api`.

## Package.json Scripts

- `generate:api` - Generates API client code and automatically applies fixes
- `generate:api:clean` - Generates API client code without applying fixes (original Kubb output)

## Known Issues Fixed

1. **Empty PathParams Interfaces**: Kubb generates empty interfaces for path parameters, causing TypeScript errors when trying to access `.id` property.

2. **Duplicate Enum Exports**: Kubb sometimes generates duplicate enum exports causing TypeScript compilation errors.

3. **Export Type Issues**: Some exports need to use `export type` for TypeScript isolated modules.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter TypeScript errors after regenerating API code:

1. Run the post-generation script manually:
   ```bash
   node scripts/post-generate.js
   ```

2. Check TypeScript errors:
   ```bash
   pnpm check-types
   ```

3. If issues persist, try regenerating with clean output and reapplying fixes:
   ```bash
   pnpm generate:api:clean
   node scripts/post-generate.js
   ```
